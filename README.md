## Implemented but Not Working Properly
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

### Not Applicable (N/A)
  - All implemented features are working properly to prevent errors and warnings.



## Features Not Implemented
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---
### <ins>1. Sound Effect and Music Background</ins>
  - The sound effect for the player's plane shooting projectiles has not been implemented.
  - The sound effect for clicking buttons has not been implemented.
  - The sound effect for defeating enemies or bosses and for the player's plane has not been implemented.
  - The background music is static, only playing one track instead of changing with the levels.

### <ins>2. Power Ups</ins>
  - Power-ups for upgrading bullets (e.g., increasing shooting speed or firing multiple lines) have not been implemented.
  - The ability to collect hearts for reviving lost hearts has not been implemented.

### <ins>3. Self-Changeable Key Bindings</ins>
  - Unable to change the control keys.
  - The control key changes are not saved during gameplay.
  - When exiting the game, the control keys retain the previous changes instead of resetting to the default.

### <ins>4. Enemy and Boss Attack Patterns</ins>
  - Currently, the enemies and bosses in the game are boring, as they only shoot one type of projectile.
  - Their movement is somewhat predictable, making the game less challenging.
  - The boss is too easy, as it only shoots one type of projectile. It would be more engaging to add varied attack patterns, such as lasers, to increase the difficulty.

### <ins>5. Game Objectives</ins>
  - The game objectives are not displayed during the levels, making it unclear to the player when or how they win.
  - The player is unable to plan tactics while playing the game.
  - For example, the player should know how many enemies need to be defeated to proceed to the next level, or how many waves they must survive to progress

### <ins>5. Health Bars</ins>
  - A health bar should be displayed for enemies and bosses, as players are unaware of their initial health and the number of projectiles needed to defeat them.
  - This would allow players to easily track the health of enemies and bosses, enhancing the gameplay experience.

### 4. LevelThree.java
#### (com/example/demo/Level/LevelThree.java)
  - The boss level was initially level 2, but with the addition of a new level in between, it has now become level 3.
  - Adjusted the boss's movements accordingly.

### 5. LevelSelection.java
#### (com/example/demo/Screen/LevelSelection.java)
  - Players can select from Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.
  - When losing a game, players donâ€™t have to start from Level 1; they can simply restart the current level.
  - A new level will only unlock after the previous level is completed.
  - Once all levels are unlocked, players can choose any level to play.

### 6. MainMenu.java
#### (com/example/demo/Screen/MainMenu.java)

  - Provides a smooth transition back to the previous screen (either the game or the main menu) once the user is done adjusting the settings.
  - show(): This method sets up the scene for the settings screen, arranges the UI components in a VBox layout, and sets the scene on the stage.
  - createBackground(): This method loads and sets the background image for the screen, scaling it to fit the screen dimensions.


## Modified Java Classes
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---
### 1. Boss.java
#### (com/example/demo/Actor/Enemy/Boss.java)
  - Made the shield visible and ensure it follows the boss as the boss moves.
  - Adjusted the hitbox to match the boss's new shape and size.
  - Changed the boss image to update its appearance.

### 2. BossProjectile.java
#### (com/example/demo/Actor/Enemy/BossProjectile.java)
  - Adjusted the image height, projectile velocity, and position to ensure smooth consistency and eliminate any sense of dissonance.

### 3. EnemyPlane.java
#### (com/example/demo/Actor/Enemy/EnemyPlane.java)
  - Adjusted the image height and position, as well as the enemy's health and fire rate in Level 1.
  - Changed the image of the enemy to update its appearance.

### 4. EnemyProjectile.java
#### (com/example/demo/Actor/Enemy/EnemyProjectile.java)
  - Adjusted the image height and projectile velocity.

### 5. UserPlane.java
#### (com/example/demo/Actor/User/UserPlane.java)
  - The user plane can now move not only up and down but also left and right.
  - The fireProjectile() method creates and fires a UserProjectile at specified offsets from the plane's current position, with projectiles fired at regular intervals controlled by a Timeline.
  - When the player takes damage, the plane becomes invincible for a short duration. During this time, the plane blinks and its collision is disabled to prevent further damage.
  - Increased the velocity of the user plane to enhance the gameplay experience and make it more fun.

### 6. UserProjectile.java
#### (com/example/demo/Actor/User/UserProjectile.java)
  - Adjusted the speed of the projectile to make gameplay more exciting.
  - Changed the asset image to update the appearance.

### 7. Controller.java
#### (com/example/demo/controller/Controller.java)
  - The controller is initialized with a Stage, which is used to manage the display of scenes, and a MediaPlayer for managing media such as background music.
  - Depending on the method called (launchLevelOne(), launchLevelTwo(), launchLevelThree()), the controller initializes the corresponding level's scene and starts the game for that level.

### 8. Main.java
#### (com/example/demo/controller/Main.java)
  - The main method calls launch(args), a static method in the Application class, which initializes the JavaFX application and eventually invokes the start method.
  - In the start method, an instance of MainMenu is created, and its start method is called to set up the main menu scene, which serves as the game's entry point where the player can interact with options like "Start Game," "Settings," or "Exit."
  - primaryStage.setResizable(false) is used to make the window size fixed, meaning the user won't be able to resize the application window.

### 9. GameOverImage.java, HeartDisplay.java, ShieldImage.java, WinImage.java
#### (com/example/demo/Image/*)
  - Designed new assets and adjusted their size.
  - In ShieldImage.java, moved the show/hide shield logic from LevelViewLevelThree.java to ShieldImage.java.

### 10. LevelOne.java
#### (com/example/demo/Level/LevelOne.java)
  - Adjusted the kill count required to advance and modified the probability rates.
  - It provides smooth transitions between the game state (win/loss), offering the player options to proceed to the next level, restart, or return to the main menu.

### 11. LevelTwo.java
#### (com/example/demo/Level/LevelTwo.java)
  - Initially a boss level, it is now positioned as a level between Level One and the boss level.
  - Adjusted the kill count required to advance and modified the probability rates.
  - It provides smooth transitions between the game state (win/loss), offering the player options to proceed to the next level, restart, or return to the main menu.

### 12. LevelParent.java
#### (com/example/demo/Level/LevelParent.java)
  - Added a `HashSet` to track input keys, preventing issues such as "lagging" visuals when moving and shooting simultaneously.
  - By tracking pressed keys accurately, the `HashSet` ensures seamless movement and shooting actions without delays or conflicts.
  - Implemented `pauseGame()` and game state checks to allow the player to pause the game, providing the flexibility to temporarily stop and resume gameplay as needed.
  - Game state checks ensure that the game is properly paused or resumed, preventing conflicts or unexpected behavior when the game is inactive.
  - Introduced a pause menu with options to resume, restart, access settings, return to the main menu, or quit, improving the user experience.
  - Added functionality to dynamically restart the game or navigate to the main menu, enhancing gameplay flexibility.
  - Optimized game loop performance by handling input actions and game updates in a timely manner, keeping gameplay smooth.
  - Enhanced collision handling for both user and enemy projectiles, improving the game's responsiveness and accuracy during interactions.
  - Ensured that the game remains responsive during pauses or state changes, offering a consistent and stable experience for the player.

### 13. LevelView.java
#### (com/example/demo/Level/LevelView.java)
  - Adjusted the images position and changed the image of heart

### 14. LevelViewLevelThree.java
#### (com/example/demo/Level/LevelViewLevelThree.java)
  - Renamed from LevelViewLevelTwo -> LevelViewLevelThree.java
  - Adjusted the shield image creation to ensure proper display.
  - Added debug statements to confirm that the shield is correctly initialized and added to the root.

## Unexpected Problems
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---
### 1. Multiple Pop-Ups
  - At the start, gotoNextLevel() did not properly handle the clearing of assets, which caused the game to crash and led to an excessive number of pop-ups, eventually crashing the PC.
    To resolve this, timeline.stop() was added to halt active timelines before proceeding to the next level.

### 2. Shield not appearing for Boss
  - The shield was initially not visible during the boss stage.
  - It was later identified that this issue stemmed from the order in which JavaFX elements were created, causing the shield to be layered behind the background.
  - To resolve this, the shield was initialized as part of the Boss object, allowing it to correctly follow the bossâ€™s movements while ensuring proper visibility.

### 3. Hitboxes Problems
  - The hitboxes did not align accurately with the images, often being larger than expected, which caused unfair hits to the player.
  - In the boss level, the boss's hitbox was disproportionately large, resulting in projectiles missing the boss visually but still causing damage.
  - To address this, the images were resized individually after being replaced, and the hitbox sizes were adjusted to ensure fair and enjoyable gameplay.

### 4. UserProjectiles Not Aligning with Player's X Position
  - After enabling the player to move left and right, it was observed that the projectiles did not align with the player's updated X position during movement.
  - To resolve this, the player's current X position was incorporated into the projectile's creation logic, ensuring it spawns correctly relative to the player's position.

### 5. Userplane Immediately Takes Damage When Colliding with Enemies
  - Without any "invincibility" frames, the player continuously took damage upon collision, unlike typical arcade games that provide a brief recovery period between hits.
  - To address this, temporary invincibility (i-Frames) was implemented, accompanied by a blinking effect and disabled collision during this period to prevent consecutive damage.

### 6. Music overlapping with each other.
  - Clicking on different buttons or navigating to other pages in the game caused the background music to loop repeatedly, creating overlapping audio playback.
  - To resolve this, checks were added to ensure the music does not restart if it is already playing, and any duplicate playback instances were stopped before initiating new ones.

### 7. Pause Menu
  - Initially, the pause menu was implemented in a separate PauseMenu class. However, despite multiple attempts and solutions, the menu did not display in the game.
  - This was due to issues with node attachment, focus handling, and scene hierarchy.
  - To resolve this, the pause menu was integrated directly into the LevelParent class. The pause menu became part of the same node hierarchy (root) as the game elements. Proper focus handling and visibility control using pausePane.toFront() and event handling. Seamless synchronization with the game state (timeline, isGamePaused).
